- **Mark tasks as completed** and filter by status (*All / Active / Completed*).  
- **Sorting options**: by creation date, due date, or title.  
- **Local storage support**: tasks remain saved even after page refresh.  
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile.

##  Technologies
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox + Grid) for styling  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** for logic and local storage
